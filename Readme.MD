Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool that allows computers to understand the
underlying subjective tone of Speech. This is something that humans have
difficulty with, and as you might imagine, it isn’t always so easy for computers,
either. But with the right tools and Python, you can use sentiment analysis to
better understand the sentiment of a speech.

Abstract


Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool that allows computers to understand the
underlying subjective tone of Speech. This is something that humans have
difficulty with, and as you might imagine, it isn’t always so easy for computers,
either. But with the right tools and Python, you can use sentiment analysis to
better understand the sentiment of a speech.


Goals
Aim is to make machines understand and detect emotions from any textual input. A text
based emotion recognition system which give an overall sentiment of the
sentence/paragraph in terms of positivity/negativity and neutrality and determine the
overall emotion.


Base Algorithm
● Analyse the impact of effective words on the Speech.


● Used supervised learning models to classify the emotion classes on given
Speech.


● Further work includes Emotional analysis on aSpeech and find the relation
using VAD.
Proposed Methodology:
Dependencies:
● Numpy
● Pandas
● NLTK
● sklearn
2
● Python3
● re
Installation:
Use pip3 to install any missing dependencies.
Approach followed is:
1. Voice input*
Speech Recognition
Speech Recognition is an important feature in several applications used such as home
automation, artificial intelligence, etc. This article aims to provide an introduction on how
to make use of the SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 library of Python.
Installation required:
● Python Speech Recognition module:
pip install speechrecognition
